Move your spaceship with flappy-bird like movement and collect stars before they disappear! A star gives 100 point, dying takes 50 away.
If you have a controller plugged in, the game will take its inputs by default: left stick to move left/right, east or south button to "jump"
If not, the keyboard controls are S/D to move left/right, W/space to "jump" for player one, left and right arrows to move and up arrow to "jump" for player two.

Due to issues encoutnered while trying to implement deterministic floating points, the online is wonky at best. :(
