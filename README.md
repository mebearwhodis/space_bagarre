Move your spaceship with flappy-bird like movement and collect stars before they disappear! <br/> 
A star gives 100 point, dying takes 50 away. <br/> 
If you have a controller plugged in, the game will take its inputs by default: left stick to move left/right, east or south button to "jump". <br/> 
If not, the keyboard controls are S/D to move left/right, W/space to "jump" for player one, left and right arrows to move and up arrow to "jump" for player two. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Due to issues encoutnered while trying to implement deterministic floating points, the online is wonky at best. :( <br/>
